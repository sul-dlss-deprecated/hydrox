# Hydrox Project

Hydrox is a project of DLSS to implement Hyku, the repository application developed in the Hydra-in-a-Box project, for use at Stanford.  

The name is a cross between “Hydrus”, the legacy self-deposit application in production at sdr.stanford.edu since 2013, and “Hybox”, the informal name of the Hydra-in-a-Box project. Hydrox will replace Hydrus as the web-based deposit interface to the Stanford Digital Repository.

# Purpose of this Repository

Please be aware that the initial use of Hyrax in this repository is not a determination of platform decision related to Hyku/Hyrax, but is being used to capture initial work related to authentication and integration with existing SUL-DLSS projects.

The state of the `master` branch of this repository should generally stay at the post `generate hyrax:install` step but pre `db:migrate` step.
